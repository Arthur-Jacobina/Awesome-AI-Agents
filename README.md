## Introduction
As computers get more powerful, AI is getting smarter incredibly fast. Now we regularly see new models with billions of parameters doing things that used to be just science fiction. Characters like Jarvis, Joi, and Rachel from movies are close to becoming real.

You might be wondering: What are these models? How do they work? Can you build one? What can you actually do with them? And how do you turn a language model into a useful assistant like the ones in movies?

In this workshop, we'll answer these questions and more as we explore AI agents and how they work in the real world. We'll cover the basics and show you how to build practical systems so you can start creating your own AI agents.

## Quick Intro to LLM
Language models have long been a cornerstone of natural language processing (NLP), using mathematical techniques to capture the rules and patterns of language for prediction and generation. Decades of research have taken us from early statistical language models (SLMs)—simple systems counting word frequencies—to today's large language models (LLMs), which boast billions of parameters and can produce human-like text. This swift evolution, especially in recent years, has turned science fiction into reality, with models now able to chat, reason, and assist in ways that rival characters like Jarvis from Iron Man.

But what's behind this leap? LLMs rely on transformer architectures, a breakthrough in neural network design that excels at understanding context by processing entire sequences of words at once. Trained on massive datasets—think books, websites, and more—these models generalize language laws, predicting what comes next in a sentence or generating responses from scratch. In this workshop, we'll peel back the layers of LLMs, showing you how they work and why they're the backbone of modern AI agents. Whether you're a coder, a dreamer, or just curious, you'll leave with a clear grasp of their potential.

### A little bit of history

#### Statistical Language Models (SLMs)
Born in the 1990s, SLMs were the first step in modeling language probabilistically. They aimed to calculate the likelihood of a sentence—like "I am very happy"—appearing in a text, expressed as \( P(S) = P(I, am, very, happy) \). Using conditional probabilities, this breaks down to \( P(I) \times P(am | I) \times P(very | I, am) \times P(happy | I, am, very) \). To estimate these, SLMs relied on Maximum Likelihood Estimation, substituting probabilities with word sequence frequencies from a training set, e.g., \( P(w_i | w_1 \ldots w_{i-1}) = \frac{C(w_1 \ldots w_i)}{C(w_1 \ldots w_{i-1})} \). The n-gram approach assumed each word depended only on the prior \( n-1 \) words, but with \( n \) typically limited to 2 or 3 due to storage constraints, accuracy suffered as vocabulary size grew exponentially.

#### Neural Language Models (NLMs)
By the early 2000s, NLMs emerged, swapping statistical counts for neural networks. They introduced word vectors—numerical representations where "cat" and "dog" are closer in vector space than "cat" and "tree," thanks to tools like Word2Vec. An NLM's structure includes an input layer (concatenating vectors of \( n-1 \) prior words), a hidden layer (applying non-linear functions like sigmoid), and an output layer (predicting the next word via Softmax, e.g., \( O_i' = \frac{\exp(O_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{|V|} \exp(O_j)} \)). This allowed NLMs to handle longer dependencies and capture semantic relationships, overcoming SLMs' rigid n-gram limits.

#### Pre-Trained Language Models (PLMs)

The 2010s brought PLMs like BERT and GPT-2, pre-trained on vast unlabeled text to learn language fundamentals—vocabulary, syntax, semantics—before fine-tuning on specific tasks like translation or question-answering. Think of it as a martial artist building a strong foundation before mastering a sword. Pre-training on huge corpora, followed by fine-tuning on smaller, task-specific datasets, made PLMs versatile and powerful, driven by the rise of transformer architectures.

### Transformer: Attention Is All You Need
In this section, we will try to give you a grasp of how a transformer works. First of all, at a high level, transformers are a type of neural network architecture introduced in the 2017 paper *"Attention Is All You Need"* by Vaswani et al. Unlike earlier models like SLMs and NLMs, which processed words sequentially or struggled with long-range dependencies, transformers revolutionized NLP by processing entire sequences of words simultaneously. This parallel processing, powered by a mechanism called "attention," allows transformers to capture context—like understanding the difference between "bank" in "river bank" vs. "money bank"—far more effectively.

#### How Transformers Work: The Big Picture
At their core, transformers are built to handle sequences, whether it's translating a sentence, generating text, or answering questions. They consist of two main parts: an **encoder** and a **decoder**. The encoder processes the input sequence (e.g., a sentence in English) and creates a rich representation of it, while the decoder generates the output sequence (e.g., the translated sentence in French). What makes transformers special is their use of **self-attention**, a mechanism that lets each word in the sequence "pay attention" to every other word, figuring out which ones are most relevant. For example, in the sentence "The cat, which slept all day, was tired," self-attention helps the model understand that "cat" and "tired" are related, even though they're far apart.

#### Self-Attention: The Magic Ingredient
Self-attention is the heart of the transformer. Here's how it works: for each word in the input, the model creates three vectors **Query (Q)**, **Key (K)**, and **Value (V)** by multiplying the word's vector (like the ones from Word2Vec in NLMs) by three different weight matrices. Then, it computes an attention score by taking the dot product of the Query of one word with the Key of every other word, scaling it, and applying a Softmax function to get a probability distribution. Mathematically, the attention output for a word is:

Attention(Q, K, V) = Softmax(QK^T/sqrt{d_k})V \]

where \( d_k \) is the dimension of the Key vector, used for scaling to prevent large values from destabilizing the computation. This process lets the model weigh the importance of other words when understanding a given word, capturing relationships that SLMs' n-grams or NLMs' sequential processing couldn't.

#### Multi-Head Attention and Layers
Transformers don't stop at one round of attention—they use **multi-head attention**, running the attention mechanism multiple times in parallel with different weight matrices. This allows the model to focus on different aspects of the sequence simultaneously (e.g., syntax, semantics). The outputs of these "heads" are concatenated and transformed to produce the final representation. A transformer typically stacks multiple layers of this multi-head attention, along with feed-forward neural networks, normalization, and residual connections, to refine the representation at each step.

#### Why Transformers Win
Transformers outperform earlier models for several reasons:
- **Parallel Processing**: Unlike sequential models, transformers process all words at once, making them faster to train on GPUs.
- **Long-Range Dependencies**: Self-attention captures relationships between distant words, solving the limitations of SLMs' small \( n \)-grams and NLMs' weaker dependency handling.
- **Scalability**: Transformers scale well with more data and compute, paving the way for LLMs like GPT-3 and beyond.

In short, transformers are the backbone of modern NLP, enabling everything from chatbots to translation systems. Their ability to understand context through attention makes them a game-changer, and they're the foundation for the LLMs we'll explore next.

### Exercise: Let's code a basic transformer

In this exercise, we'll implement a transformer from scratch using PyTorch, following the architecture described in "Attention Is All You Need". You can find the complete implementation in `transformer.ipynb`.

#### Key Components

1. **Attention Mechanism**
   - Single attention head computes: \[ Attention(Q,K,V) = Softmax(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}})V \]
   - Multi-head attention allows model to focus on different aspects simultaneously
   - Implementation includes masking for decoder self-attention

2. **Core Building Blocks**
   ```python
   class Head(nn.Module):
       def __init__(self, model_dim, head_size):
           super().__init__()
           self.k = nn.Linear(model_dim, head_size)
           self.q = nn.Linear(model_dim, head_size)
           self.v = nn.Linear(model_dim, head_size)
   ```

3. **Position-wise Feed-Forward Network**
   - Two linear transformations with ReLU activation
   - Helps process transformed attention outputs

4. **Positional Encoding**
   - Adds position information using sine and cosine functions
   - Enables model to understand word order without recurrence

5. **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**
   - Stabilizes training through normalization
   - Skip connections help with gradient flow

#### Architecture Overview

The transformer consists of:
- Encoder: Self-attention + feed-forward layers
- Decoder: Self-attention + cross-attention + feed-forward layers
- Both use residual connections and layer normalization

```python
class Transformer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, src_vocab_size, tgt_vocab_size, d_model=512, num_heads=8,
                 d_ff=2048, num_layers=6, dropout=0.1, max_seq_length=5000):
        super().__init__()
```

#### Training the Model

The notebook includes a complete training loop with:
- Learning rate scheduling
- Gradient clipping
- Validation monitoring
- Model checkpointing

Try running the notebook and experiment with:
- Different model sizes (d_model, num_heads)
- Various learning rates and optimizers
- Different sequence lengths and batch sizes

For the complete implementation and training code, refer to `transformer.ipynb` in this repository.

If you find any error please create an issue addressing the problem.

### Factors Influencing LLM Development
What fueled this rise? Three big drivers stand out:

- **Compute Power**: As computers got faster (think GPUs and TPUs), training giant models became feasible.
- **Data Explosion**: The internet provided a flood of text—Wikipedia, forums, X posts—giving LLMs raw material to learn from.
- **Algorithmic Breakthroughs**: Transformers and techniques like fine-tuning made models smarter and more adaptable.

Today's LLMs, like GPT-3 (175 billion parameters, 570GB of text) vs. GPT-2 (1.5 billion parameters, 40GB), showcase this scale. Their ability to align with human values and generalize across tasks marks a leap from specialized PLMs to all-purpose language wizards.

## Most popular LLM models
There's a growing lineup of LLM models, each with unique strengths. Here's a quick rundown of some heavy hitters as of early 2025:

- LLaMA (Meta AI): The LLaMA series, particularly LLaMA 3.3, is developed by Meta AI and is noted for its dialogue capabilities, supporting 8 languages including English, French, German, Hindi, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Thai. It is optimized for consumer hardware, making it accessible for developers without extensive computational resources.
- DeepSeek: DeepSeek R1, from DeepSeek AI, is designed for reasoning tasks, utilizing a Mixture of Experts framework. It supports over 20 languages and is particularly strong in scientific and technical domains, making it suitable for applications requiring logical inference and mathematical problem-solving. (also look at DeepSeek V3)
- Qwen: Qwen, developed by Alibaba, is notable for its multilingual support (29+ languages) and multimodal capabilities. The Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct version excels in coding and mathematical tasks, leveraging advanced transformer architectures like RoPE, SwiGLU, RMSNorm, and Attention QKV. (SOTA: QwQ 32b - reasoning model)
- GPT Series (OpenAI): From ChatGPT to GPT-4 and beyond, these models are known for their versatility and conversational prowess. They excel in natural language understanding and generation. (NOTE: really good for structured outputs, will get back to it later)
- Grok (xAI): Designed by X to be truthful and helpful, it was built to assist and provide clear answers, often with a dash of outside perspective on humanity.
Gemini (Google): A multimodal contender, blending text, images, and more, with a focus on integration into Google's ecosystem.
- Claude (Anthropic): Prioritizing safety and interpretability, Claude is a favorite for applications where alignment with human values is key.
Each model has trade-offs—some are open-source, others proprietary; some shine in reasoning, others in creative tasks. We'll explore what makes these models tick and how to pick the right one for your AI agent.

## AI "beyond" LLMs
While large language models (LLMs) have dominated the AI landscape with their text generation and reasoning capabilities, the frontier of artificial intelligence is rapidly expanding beyond text to include other modalities like voice, images, and video. These advancements are enabling AI systems to interact with the world in richer, more human-like ways, opening up new possibilities for applications that go far beyond chatbots and text-based assistants. Let's take a quick look at how voice, image, and video models—many thriving in the open-source community—are pushing the boundaries of AI.

### Voice Models
Voice-based AI has evolved from clunky speech recognition to systems that synthesize natural-sounding speech and understand nuanced intonations. Models like OpenAI's Whisper (open-source) excel at transcribing spoken language across accents and noisy environments, while text-to-speech systems like ElevenLabs (proprietary) or the open-source F5TTS produce voices nearly indistinguishable from humans. F5TTS (Flow-based Five-step Text-to-Speech), with its 335 million parameters and training on 95,000 hours of multilingual data (English and Chinese), offers near-human-quality synthesis and zero-shot voice cloning—mimicking a voice from a short sample. Available on GitHub, it runs on modest hardware (6-16GB VRAM), making it a gem for building talking agents. These models, often built on transformer or flow-based architectures, are powering virtual assistants, audiobooks, and real-time translation.

### Image Models
Image generation and understanding have exploded with models like DALL·E 3 (proprietary) and the open-source titan Stable Diffusion. Built on diffusion models or GANs, Stable Diffusion lets anyone generate photorealistic images from text prompts or edit existing photos, with countless community forks tailoring it to specific styles. On the perception side, CLIP (open-source from OpenAI) bridges text and images, enabling zero-shot classification—like finding "dog" pictures in a gallery. These tools are transforming creative industries, autonomous systems (e.g., self-driving cars), and medical imaging, all while being accessible to developers thanks to open-source efforts.

### Video Models
Video is the next frontier, blending image and voice with temporal complexity. Proprietary models like Sora (OpenAI) generate stunning clips from text, but open-source options like HunyuanVideo are catching up fast. Released by Tencent in December 2024 with 13 billion parameters, HunyuanVideo uses a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture to create high-quality 5-second videos (up to 720p) from text prompts. Available on GitHub and Hugging Face with pre-trained weights, it's already spawning community extensions like LoRA fine-tuning for custom animations. Video understanding models, meanwhile, track objects and predict actions, paving the way for applications in entertainment, education, and surveillance.

### Wrap up
These modalities don't just stand alone—they're merging with LLMs into multimodal systems. An agent could hear your voice, see your surroundings, and respond with a video or spoken answer, bringing us closer to sci-fi companions like Jarvis. In the rest of this workshop, we'll explore how these tools give agents "superpowers" beyond text, setting the stage for real-world impact.

## When AI meets the Real World
Large language models (LLMs) are great at understanding and generating text, but on their own, they're stuck in a world of words. To be truly useful in the real world, they need the ability to call tools and interact with their environment, essentially becoming agents. Here's why this capability is a must.

### LLMs alone aren't enough
LLMs can process vast amounts of text and give smart answers, but they can't act beyond that. They're limited to:

- Answering questions based on what they've been trained on.
- Generating text like emails or stories.

But they can't:

- Check the weather right now.
- Book a flight for you.
- Turn off your smart lights.

Without the ability to interact with the world, LLMs are just clever talkers, not problem solvers.

### Tools turn LLMs into Agents
Tools are external resources—like APIs, databases, or devices—that LLMs can use to perform specific tasks. When an LLM can call these tools, it becomes an agent, capable of:

- Perceiving: Gathering real-time info (e.g., stock prices, traffic conditions).
- Deciding: Figuring out what to do based on that info.
- Acting: Executing tasks (e.g., sending a message, adjusting a thermostat).

For example:

- You ask, "What's the weather like today?" A basic LLM might guess based on old data. An agent uses a weather API to give you the latest forecast.
- You say, "Schedule a meeting for 3 PM." An agent taps into your calendar tool and makes it happen.

This shift from text-only to action-oriented is what makes AI practical.

### Why this is critical
The real world demands more than words—it needs action. Here's why LLMs must have this ability:

- Solves Real Problems: Agents can automate tasks like ordering groceries or managing schedules, saving time and effort.
- Adapts to You: They can tailor actions to your specific needs, like finding a restaurant you'd love and booking it.
- Handles Complexity: From controlling smart homes to optimizing business workflows, agents tackle multi-step challenges humans can't easily manage.

Imagine an LLM in healthcare: without tools, it can only describe symptoms. As an agent, it could monitor a patient, alert a doctor, and adjust treatments in real time.

For LLMs to go from being smart chatbots to indispensable helpers, they need to call tools and interact with their environment. It's not optional, it's essential. This ability bridges the gap between digital intelligence and real-world impact, making AI not just a talker, but a doer.

## Giving superpowers to LLM
You might be wondering: how can I make a large language model (LLM) call a tool? At its core, this is about enhancing an LLM's capabilities beyond just generating text—turning it into something more dynamic and interactive. One way to achieve this is through instruct models, which are specialized LLMs fine-tuned to follow commands and execute specific tasks, like summarizing text or translating sentences. However, for this workshop, we won't dig deeper into the details of instruct models. Instead, let's focus on a practical approach: using frameworks that make it easy to integrate tools with LLMs, effectively giving them "superpowers."

At a high level, there are several frameworks designed to enable LLMs to call external tools and interact with the world around them. These frameworks simplify the process so you don't need to build everything from scratch. Today, we'll zoom in on one in particular: LangGraph. But before we dive into LangGraph, let's briefly touch on why this matters and what it enables.

### Why choose LangGraph
LangGraph stands out for a few key reasons:

- **Simplified Agent Building**: It provides a clear structure for defining workflows, making it easier to manage an agent's tasks.
- **Tool Integration**: You can define tools—like APIs or databases—and specify when the LLM should call them.
- **State Management**: It tracks the conversation or task state, ensuring the agent knows what to do next.

Imagine an agent that:

1. Receives a user request, like "What's the weather like today?"
2. Recognizes it needs external data and calls a weather API.
3. Uses the API's response to craft an answer, such as "It's sunny and 75°F in your area."

LangGraph makes this kind of workflow manageable to implement.

### How LangGraph work
At its core, LangGraph organizes an agent's behavior into three main components:

- **Nodes**: These are the building blocks of the workflow, representing actions (e.g., calling a tool) or decision points (e.g., checking what the user asked).
- **Edges**: These connect the nodes, defining the flow based on conditions or outcomes.
- **State**: A shared object that holds information—like user inputs or tool outputs—across the workflow.

For example, a node might check if a user's request requires real-time data. If it does, the workflow moves to a tool-calling node; if not, it skips to generating a response directly.

In the following sections, we'll set up LangGraph for practical use by defining simple tools and connecting them to an LLM (react agent).

By the end, you'll have the skills to create your own AI agents that can interact with the world think personal assistants, trading bots, or even automated support systems. Let's move forward and bring these superpowers to life!

### Exercise: Let's create a weather agent

In this exercise, we'll build a smart weather agent using LangGraph that can handle different types of weather-related queries. Our agent will demonstrate key concepts like routing, tool usage, and state management. (You can look at the complete implementation at /ai_agents/weather.py)

#### Key Components

1. **Weather Tool (service.py)**
   - A simple tool that simulates weather data retrieval
   - Returns temperature and conditions for any location
   - In a production environment, this would connect to a real weather API

2. **Router System**
   - Routes queries to appropriate handlers based on complexity:
     - `direct_weather`: Simple location-based queries
     - `agent`: Complex weather-related questions needing reasoning
     - `general`: Non-weather queries

3. **State Management (schemas.py)**
   - Tracks conversation history and routing decisions
   - Uses TypedDict for type safety

#### Running the Example
1. Set up your environment:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key'
   ```

2. Run the weather agent:
   ```bash
   python weather.py
   ```

3. Try different types of queries:
   ```python
   # Direct weather query
   "What's the weather in SF?"
   
   # Complex weather query
   "Should I bring an umbrella to work? I'm in NYC"
   
   # Non-weather query
   "What is the capital of France?"
   ```

#### Key Learnings
- How to structure an agent with multiple processing paths
- Using tools to extend LLM capabilities
- Managing state in a conversation flow
- Routing queries based on complexity and type

### How to make an AI trade on your behalf? 
Imagine an AI that can buy and sell cryptocurrencies for you, reacting to market shifts or following your custom strategies all without you lifting a finger. This is something you can set up simply by treating a crypto wallet as a simple set of tools for your AI to use. Better yet, it’s not hard to implement, and the blockchain provides the perfect financial backbone for these AI agents. Let’s break it down step-by-step and explore why this works so well.

#### Treating a Crypto Wallet as a tool
A crypto wallet is just a digital tool that manages your cryptocurrencies—holding funds, sending payments, or receiving assets. For an AI to trade on your behalf, you can give it access to this wallet in the same way you’d let an AI tap into a weather API for real-time forecasts. Here’s an high-level look at how to make it happen:

1. Set up a crypto wallet and provide controlled access to your AI agent by securely managing private keys within the execution environment
2. Design a wallet provider interface with clear abstraction methods that serve as a bridge between your AI agent and blockchain functionality
3. Implement essential blockchain operations (Transfers, Trades, Balance Checks) as discrete tools the AI can utilize when needed

This simple implementation can be expanded with several security-focused improvements:

- Transaction Approval Flow: Configure the system so the AI only constructs proposed transactions that require explicit user signatures before execution, significantly reducing security risks
- Permission Scoping: Implement granular permissions to limit which operations the AI can perform and set transaction thresholds
- Audit Logging: Create comprehensive logging of all AI-initiated actions for transparency and security monitoring

By implementing these measures, you can balance the convenience of AI-assisted crypto management with appropriate security safeguards, substantially lowering the trust barrier while protecting your digital assets.

#### Challenge: create a crypto agent that can transfer ETH


## An Intro to Agentic Systems
So far, we’ve explored how large language models (LLMs) can chat, reason, and even call tools to interact with the world. But what happens when you want an AI that doesn’t just respond to one-off questions—like “What’s the weather?”—but instead tackles multi-step, real-world tasks? Enter agentic systems: the next level of AI that can plan, adapt, and act dynamically. In this section, we’ll break down what agentic systems are, why they’re a game-changer, and the most common architectures you’ll encounter as you build your own AI agents.

#### What Are Agentic Systems?
Think of an agentic system as an LLM with a brain and hands. It’s not just spitting out text—it’s figuring out what to do, when to do it, and how to get it done. At Anthropic, they define agentic systems broadly: any setup where an LLM orchestrates tools or workflows to solve problems. But there’s a key split in how these systems are built:

- Workflows: The LLM follows a predefined script—like a recipe. You code the steps (e.g., “check the weather, then suggest an outfit”), and the LLM fills in the blanks with its smarts.
- Agents: The LLM takes the wheel. It decides the steps, picks the tools, and adjusts on the fly based on what’s happening—like a sous-chef improvising a meal from whatever’s in the kitchen.

Both are agentic, but agents are more autonomous, making them ideal for open-ended challenges where the path isn’t set in stone. Imagine asking your AI, “Plan my weekend in São Paulo.” A workflow might churn out a static itinerary, while an agent could check the weather, book a restaurant, and pivot if it rains—all without you micromanaging.

#### Why Go Agentic?
LLMs alone are like genius librarians—they’ve read everything but can’t leave the library. Agentic systems break them out, letting them act in the real world. Here’s why that matters:

- Tackles Complexity: Multi-step tasks—like trading crypto or managing customer support—need more than one-shot answers. Agents handle the back-and-forth.
- Adapts on the Fly: Real life throws curveballs. Agents can rethink their approach if a tool fails or new info pops up.
- Scales Your Ideas: Want an AI to run your crypto trades 24/7 or answer customer queries nonstop? Agents make it happen.

But there’s a catch: more power means more complexity, cost, and sometimes unpredictability. The trick is knowing when to keep it simple (a single LLM call) versus when to unleash an agent. Spoiler: start simple, then level up when you need to.

### Most Common Architectures
Building an agentic system isn’t about reinventing the wheel—it’s about picking the right pattern for your task. Drawing from real-world implementations (and Anthropic’s insights), here are the most common architectures you’ll see. Each one’s a building block you can tweak or combine for your own projects.

1. **Prompt Chaining**
- What It Is: Break a task into steps, where each LLM call feeds into the next—like passing a baton in a relay race.
- How It Works: You define the sequence (e.g., “write an outline, then draft an email”), and the LLM processes one chunk at a time. Add checks between steps to keep it on track.
- When to Use It: Perfect for tasks with clear, predictable stages—like generating a report or translating a document.
- Example: “Summarize this article, then turn it into a tweet.” Step 1: LLM summarizes. Step 
2: LLM crafts the tweet.

2. **Routing**
- What It Is: The LLM sorts inputs and sends them to the right handler—like a traffic cop directing cars.
- How It Works: It classifies the request (e.g., “weather query” vs. “general question”) and routes it to a specialized workflow or tool.
- When to Use It: Great for mixed-bag inputs, like customer service where queries range from “Where’s my order?” to “How do I reset my password?”
- Example: “What’s the weather in Rio?” → Routes to a weather tool. “What’s Brazil’s capital?” → Routes to a general knowledge response.

3. **Parallelization**
- What It Is: Split a task into pieces that run at the same time, then combine the results—like a team of chefs cooking different dishes for a feast.
- How It Works: Either break a big job into subtasks (sectioning) or run the same task multiple times for better accuracy (voting).
- When to Use It: Use it for speed (parallel subtasks) or confidence (multiple takes on a tricky question).
- Example: “Review this code for bugs.” Three LLM calls check different angles—syntax, logic, security—then merge findings.

4. **Orchestrator-Workers**
- What It Is: One LLM (the orchestrator) delegates tasks to other LLMs or tools (workers), then ties it all together—like a project manager with a crew.
- How It Works: The orchestrator decides what needs doing (e.g., “search this, calculate that”), assigns jobs, and synthesizes the output.
- When to Use It: Ideal for complex, unpredictable tasks where the steps depend on the input—like coding a feature or researching a topic.
- Example: “Plan a trip to Salvador.” Orchestrator assigns: “Worker 1, check flights. Worker 2, find hotels.” Then it builds the itinerary.

5. **Evaluator-Optimizer**
- What It Is: One LLM generates a response, another critiques it, and they loop until it’s perfect—like a writer and editor polishing a draft.
- How It Works: The generator spits out an answer, the evaluator scores it (e.g., “too vague”), and they iterate.
- When to Use It: Best for tasks needing refinement, like writing a killer blog post or nailing a tricky translation.
- Example: “Translate this poem into Portuguese.” Generator translates, evaluator flags awkward phrasing, and they refine it.

6. **Autonomous Agents**
- What It Is: The full Jarvis experience—an LLM that plans, acts, and learns from feedback in a loop, no hand-holding required.
- How It Works: Given a goal (e.g., “trade ETH for me”), it picks tools, makes decisions, and adjusts based on results (e.g., market data). It might pause for your input or stop after a set limit.
- When to Use It: Open-ended problems where flexibility trumps predictability—like managing investments or solving coding puzzles.
- Example: “Keep my crypto portfolio balanced.” It monitors prices, trades when needed, and reports back.

#### Tips for success
1. Start Simple: Don’t jump to autonomous agents if a single LLM call works. Add complexity only when it pays off.
2. Test: Agents can go off the rails—sandbox them first and set guardrails (e.g., max steps, human checkpoints).
3. Know Your Tools: Clear tool docs and interfaces (like we’ll craft for our crypto wallet) make or break an agent.
